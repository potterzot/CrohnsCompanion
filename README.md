##CrohnsCompanion

An app designed to track the wellness of people with Crohn's Disease. Still in it's infancy, but a wishlist of features would be something like:

* complete anonymity
* complete open access to all user data
* allow logging of symptoms
* medication tracker
* interface with fitness/health trackers
* allow logging of foods and activities
* statistical learning of associations between symptoms and foods and activities
* health status evaluation and warning of potential inflammation
* statistical learning based on other users (anonymized). I.e. learning can happen across both an individual's historical data as well as the entire user bases data.
